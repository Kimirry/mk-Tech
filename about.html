            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-10">Simple, smart, stunning web design — powered by MK Tech.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
                MK Tech is more than just a web design startup — it’s a digital mindset. We were born from a simple
                idea: that every business, creator, and startup deserves a strong online presence that feels authentic
                and looks exceptional. In a time when websites are often templated, rushed, or bloated, we decided to do
                things differently — to go back to what really matters: clarity, performance, and purpose.
            </p>
            <button><a href="services.html">Our services</a></button>

            <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed" data-aos="fade-in">
                Our approach is simple: we listen first. We want to understand what makes your brand tick, who you're
                trying to reach, and what you're trying to solve. Then we get to work — not with shortcuts, but with
                strategy, custom code, and a designer's eye. Our sites aren’t just functional — they tell stories, move
                people, and drive results.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed" data-aos="sli">
                We're a small team (for now), but we're fueled by big ideas. We work with HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS,
                JavaScript, and React — not because they’re trendy, but because they’re powerful and scalable. We write
                code like it matters. Because it does. Behind every website we build is careful planning, thoughtful
                design, and clean development.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
                We believe great websites are simple — not simplistic. They load fast, work beautifully on every screen,
                and reflect your brand in every pixel. They’re not just “online brochures.” They’re tools — for reaching
                audiences, creating experiences, and growing your mission.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
                We don’t do “one-size-fits-all” — we do custom. Every project we take on is unique. Whether it’s a
                personal portfolio, a small business homepage, or a startup landing page, we build from scratch, by
                hand, with intention.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Why MK Tech?</h3>
